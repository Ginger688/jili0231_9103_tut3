### Sound motion effect
The whole composition in the rotating sense of movement, with visual symbols to convey the auditory feelings, the extreme anxiety generated by the scream into an abstract artistic conception, through the picture to vividly show. In this assignment, I used sound to convey this work, hoping to show the artistic conception and overall dynamic effect of this work.
1. ##### Loading audio sources
The sound source is the theme song of "Stranger Things", which is more in line with the theme of this work and expresses a sense of pressure and tension.
> These is the introduction of the song.

2. ##### The sound amplitudes from FFT
FFT analysis was used to obtain the sound amplitudes from 20 to 500 Hz of the sound source as the source of subsequent motion generation.

1. ##### Wave Animation
The amplitude of the sound was controlled at one eighth of the screen height, and the amplitude of the wave was replaced by the amplitude of the sound to realize that the wave followed the sound constantly changing.

> The map function is used to control the wave amplitude
- let wave_amplitude=map(sound_amplitude,0,255,0,height/8);
> Use the amplitude of the sound to control the wave fluctuation
- let waveHeight = map(noise(xoff), 0, 1, -this.amplitude, this.amplitude);

2. ##### Lines Animation
The amplitude of the sound is used to adjust the Angle of the line segment and cause it to produce a slight movement.(The static lines drawing code is from ChatGPT)

> Update the amplitude value of the lines object
- lines.amplitude = sound_amplitude;

> The Angle of the line segment is changed with the amplitude of the sound
- let change_angle=map(this.amplitude,0,255,-PI / 4, PI / 4);
- let angle = map(this.amplitude, 0, 255, 0, change_angle);

> Changing the position of the line segment with the amplitude of the sound produces a slight movement
- let change_scope=map(this.amplitude,0,255,0,width*0.1);
- line(x1+10*noise(this.amplitude), y1+10*noise(this.amplitude), x2+10*noise(this.amplitude), y2+change_scope); 

3. ##### Human Animation
The characters are divided into screaming people and pedestrians. The screaming people change their position and mouth size by using the sound amplitude to produce the effect of scream shaking. The louder the sound, the bigger the mouth, and the pedestrians only make a slight position movement.

> The amplitude of the sound is used to adjust the position of the person
- translate(this.x+5*noise(this.amplitude), this.y+5*noise(this.amplitude));
- translate(this.x+10*noise(this.amplitude), this.y+10*noise(this.amplitude));

> The amplitude of the sound is used to adjust the size of the mouth
- let mouth_height=map(this.amplitude,0,255,0,this.size * 0.3);
- ellipse(0, this.size * 0.15, this.size * 0.16, mouth_height);

3. ##### Boat Animation
The boat is positioned at the lake in the image, and the sound makes the boat shake

> Use the amplitude of the sound to make the boat feel swaying
- translate(this.x+5*noise(this.amplitude),this.y+5*noise(this.amplitude));
